###### Maybe this makes it easier to start up a java/maven/travis/coveralls project?

1. Check out this project
2. Create a git repo for your new project
3. Go to https://travis-ci.org and add your new project repository
4. Do the same at https://coveralls.io
5. Run rename.sh with your project name as the only parameter (`sh rename.sh my-awesome-project`) this:
* renames the project and organization in your pom.xml
* renames the links to travis and coveralls in this README
* changes the remote origin path in .git/config to point at the new repo
* changes the folder name for your local repo
  * so you should `cd` to your project directory after running the script (you're already there but it looks like you aren't)
6. Probably delete rename.sh after that
7. Edit this file to remove all these steps
8. Eat more vegetables
